# Shift-Cipher-Loop
This loop takes a given word in numbers and prints the word, with one shift per iteration of the loop.  Therefore, iterating the loop 10 times for a given word will give all versions of that word with shifts of 1 through 10.  It was written in the MIPS assembly language for ECSE 314.
