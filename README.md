# Shift-Cipher-Loop
This loop takes a given word in numbers and prints the word, with one shift per iteration of the loop.  Therefore, iterating the loop 10 times for a given word will give all versions of that word with shifts of 1 through 10.

The difference between the prototype and final version is that the final version prints ASCII characters in between numbers and iterations to make it easier to read, as well as utilizing an actual loop to make changing the number of iterations and therefore how many/which shifts easier than editing every line of code.

Written in the MIPS assembly language to be used in QTSPIM for ECSE 314.
